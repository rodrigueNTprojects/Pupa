On pupa-root folder
(I need to add the overriding section inside package.json)

Before using pupa-webportal you need to install angular-cli. Knowing that you have already install NodeJS, you can run the following command
4-npm install -g @angular/cli

Go to the folder pupa-webportal and run the following command
5-npm install
6-ng serve

NB: The prototype is more stable for NodeJS 14.x and Angular cli 13.3.8 and below
